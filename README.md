# RoboND-MapMyWorld

RTAB-Map is the best solution for SLAM and robot mapping the 3D environment as the packages is robust in speed, memory management, custom developed tools for easy debug and information analysis tools. Using rtabmap_ros package with ROS wrapper APIs it's ease to build 3D maps for this project. Primarily the RTAB-Map gives the ability to add and use 2D laser, Odometry and RGB-D sensor for mapping. However, for this project we are going to use RGB-D sensor (kinect) as we can use images, depthimage data, laser scan feed,  Odometry for navigation purpose. 


### Challenges/Project Tasks 
#### 1. 2D and 3D mapping for supplied environment
#### 2. Build own environment and generate 2D, 3D maps
